Prerequisites:

    - Clone the repository locally
    - Create a branch from master with the following name: "test/FirstName_LastName"
    - The commits should be made only on your branch (we encourage frequent commits)


Requirements:

1. Configure the Hibernate framework to:

    - Connect the application to a database
    - Map the "Product" class to the database
    - Implement the methods from ProductDAO interface
    - Create a "Category" model in order to have a relation with the "Product" and map it to DB
    - Add a (CRUD) method of your choice to include the "Category" model


2. Wire the application using Spring framework, on the existing codebase as follows:

    - You can use annotations or xml configuration
    - The functionalities in ProductDAO must reflect in the presentation layer
    - You can use (and even extend) the existing views for testing purposes
