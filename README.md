# Spring-MVC-Crud

Hello! This repo consists of a Spring MVC project with CRUD operations.

On the backend side was used:
  - Spring-MVC (creating IOC containers using class configurations)
  - MySql as database 
  - Hibernate for persistance

On the front-end side was used:
  - Html
  - Css (Bootstrap)
  - JSP
 Below you can find the requirements:

    Configure the Hibernate framework to:
        Connect the application to a database
        Map the "Product" class to the database
        Implement the methods from ProductDAO interface
        Create a "Category" model in order to have a relation with the "Product" and map it to DB
        Add a (CRUD) method of your choice to include the "Category" model

    Wire the application using Spring framework, on the existing codebase as follows:
        You can use annotations or xml configuration
        The functionalities in ProductDAO must reflect in the presentation layer
        You can use (and even extend) the existing views for testing purposes
